Ok, to I decided to set my github webpage account up.

I'll put some info about the projects here (and some tech posts probably, when I feel like it). Not like anybody is going to read this anyway but hey... :)

Jekyll is a cool tool by the way, I just need to work on the layout a bit more and it's going to be pretty neat. It already feels like home. :D
